Introduction Work Integrated learning (WIL) a crucial opportunity for students to be able to form a bridge between the knowledge we gain in the classroom in a theoretical manner and actually put into practice in a real-world setting. The purpose of WIL is to provide students with exposure to the industry in its authentic sense, the environment, where academic concepts can be applied, practical skills can be developed and students gain insight into real-world standards and expectations. Throughout my WIL placement with U-Turn Homeless Organisation, I was privileged to work alongside Tshwanelo Ramongalo to help develop NourishNet, a cross platform app that is designed to connect recipients in need with food donors. I was a part of this project for my contribution to gain an understanding of how the technology can be used to drive sustainable social impacts. I understand some part of the production with him a production solution addressing need in the world. The value of WIL to me stretched far beyond just the technical aspect but also instilled a newfound appreciation for the management of stakeholders, communication, methodologies as well as the importance of developing technology solutions that are not just functional but meaningful.

Skills Learnt Throughout this journey, I create some part of the user interface like menu items to show you my practical skills of my code with my project manager with an example to understand the illustration during WIL.

Technical Skills and Industry Practices Agile Development and SDLC: I learned how to create a login and logout in another semester to show my contribution in the project we create together of course he gives me some advice to develop every part like homepage, loginpage, patterns, style.css and menu. These parts we create together show me I have to learn more in design application for my future perspective and to have ability in my coding. He learned well how to structure sprint reviews with retrospectives, which in turn helped me refine my ability when it comes to managing scope and timelines.

Full-Stack Mobile Development:
Developing the core features in the app with him I gain more experience in React Native when developing login, post, basic information of the categories, description, verification QR code and views of the presentation of the donations we create together. When developing the donation, posting, claim management alongside with Tshwanelo give me the time to handle cross-platform complexities like IOS, Android and Web.

Cloud Backend Integration:
Using GitHub actions, he established a CI/CD pipeline to automate the quality checks for code and ran unit test (Jest). His responsibility was to test the coverage for all the business logic and prevent regression.

Quality Assurance & DevOps:
Of course he made sure to follow professional Git branching strategies like feature branches, code reviews and pull requests to efficiently collaborate with my team whilst using a shared codebase.



Version Control:

Role in the team:

Team Dynamic and Reporting
Out team consisted of myself as the Mobile/UI and Tshwanelo Ramongalo as the PM/full-stack developer. Together we ensured to maintain a codebase and experience that is dynamic, complementary and collaborative. I really excelled on the visual design aspect which gave me the true freedom to focus on the backend . We reported directly to Stephen Underwood who heads the media and donations team at U-Turn for the direction of the project and obtaining feedback from the clients perspective.

My role and my contribution was assigned to be The Mobile and UI. The responsibility of my role is allowing me to express in the developement in the app.

Leardership Contribution:
The facilitation of all the sprint activities like planning and retrospectives and ensuring to assign tasks based on our skill-sets and provide guidance on a technical level for the backend integration and security functions. Through this he ensured that he adhered to the Agile methodology.

Team Success
Through his contribution in the prioritization of documentation like the meeting minutes and technical architecture as well as removing the technical blockers proactively which in turn allowed me to focus more on the UI/UX development. Through my work we ensure an application that is not only of high quality but has a secure foundation.

Research, Technology and the Presentation of Information In order to overcome some of the more complex technical challenges, finding accurate and relevant information played a major role.

Scenario: Resolving Cross-Platform Map Integration he was tasked to handle the implementation of an interactive map that would work seamlessly across both mobile and web platforms which was challenging as the react native maps feature isn't supported on the web.

Aspect Details of Information Use Technology Used Presentation of Information Information Sought How to replace React Native Maps functionality on the web platform, specifically using the Google Maps API. Google Search, Expo Documentation, Stack Overflow. Presented a technical proposal to the team myself detailing the recommended @react-google-maps/api library, its pros/cons, and estimated effort, followed by a proof-of-concept branch. Information Found Documentation for Google Maps Platform API key setup, usage limits, and integration guides for the @react-google-maps/api library. Google Maps Platform Documentation and GitHub for code examples. he created the final implementation and documented the API key setup and configuration steps in the Systems Manual for U-Turn's IT staff.

Scenario: Designing Secure Data Access he was expected to design robust security rules to ensure user data privacy and prevent unauthorized modification of donations, a critical client requirement.

He was also in charge of designing the security rules to make sure that data privacy is intact and that unauthorized changes to the donations wasn't possible which was a critical requirement from the client. Information Found: Official Firebase Security Rules documentation, best practices from security blogs (Firebase, 2025), and the OWASP Mobile Top 10 for mobile security guidelines. (OWASP, 2025)

Technology Used: he used the Firebase emulator suite to handle the automated testing for the security rules against the multiple user roles and then he made use of the firebase console to test interactively.

Presentation: Based on the firebase rules document, he also create a thorough security review document to hand to the client which was aimed at summarizing the access controls such as only the original donor being able to edit a donation, which was then presented to the clients IT Intern, James Korkie.

Personal Strengths and Weaknesses Personal Strengths:
The part of this WIL I understand that I need to improve my management plan with him because he shows me plan to work on the mobile app after that I work on well in this part of course I did not yet understand the firebase like he did so badly the coding. Some times I make mistake in the code when it is not working and we improviite together. The most efficient way to debug when errors or conflicts prevented progress, like errors in the firestore permissions or the image retry logic or when designing the system architecture in a broader sense. Perfecting this skill allowed us as a team to really take charge of challenges like the offline queueing functionality in an efficient manner.

Security and Quality: When brainstorming with my team, he took initiative when it came to the firestore security rules and handling the integration and unit testing, where he made sure that the app stood on a secure and robust foundation. Displaying these security measures to the relevant stakeholder impressed them in terms of how much detail goes into preventing certain unwanted actions.

Client Communication: he effectively managed client expectations, translating technical project status and risks into clear, non-technical language during check-ins.

The expectations of the client were managed very efficiently with the technical project risks and status being translated into concise, clear and non-technical language throughout our checkins.

Self-Directed Learning: he quickly mastered React Native and the required Firebase services without formal training, allowing me to contribute significantly from Sprint 1.

he was able to rapidly master the React Native library with the help of my team without much guidance as figuring things out along the way and discovering what makes them break is the flow state where I learnt the most about the library and its capabilities cross-platform.

Documentation: Of course he documented all project documentation alongside my team, specifically the technical manual and user manual with POE documentation to bring the project together. Personal Weaknesses (Areas for Improvement)

UI/UX Design and Visual Polish: I’m the best when it comes to aesthetics and having a good eye for design was a trait. The user flow aspects like styling responsively and the consistency of the design was where I can help Tshwanelo with the expertise of the UI/UX.

Improvement: Dedicate time to improving modern UI/UX principles and their integrations in design systems to bridge this knowledge gap.
He occasionally took on complex technical tasks that could have been delegated, to ensure quality and speed. This limited Lidvin's exposure to some backend systems.
For my delegation in the part of team I try my best with some basics I learn from the past few years with a lot of people who explain me what to do with code I do not understand without see what do they code mean to me before explaining what to do.

For my improvement I have to get more experience for what to do with my knowloedge from coding or design even learning how to get a map in the first coding. For the message I have to say for message "DO NOT GIVE UP IF IT IS VERY DIFFICULT".
