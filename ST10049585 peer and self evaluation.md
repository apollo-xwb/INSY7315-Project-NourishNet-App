Introduction Work Integrated learning (WIL) a crucial opportunity for students to be able to form a bridge between the knowledge we gain in the classroom in a theoretical manner and actually put into practice in a real-world setting. The purpose of WIL is to provide students with exposure to the industry in its authentic sense, the environment, where academic concepts can be applied, practical skills can be developed and students gain insight into real-world standards and expectations. Throughout my WIL placement with U-Turn Homeless Organisation, I was privileged to work alongside Tshwanelo Ramongalo to help develop NourishNet, a cross platform app that is designed to connect recipients in need with food donors. I was a part of this project for my contribution to gain an understanding of how the technology can be used to drive sustainable social impacts. I understand some part of the production with him a production solution addressing need in the world. The value of WIL to me stretched far beyond just the technical aspect but also instilled a newfound appreciation for the management of stakeholders, communication, methodologies as well as the importance of developing technology solutions that are not just functional but meaningful.

Skills Learnt Throughout this journey, I create some part of the user interface like menu items to show you my practical skills of my code with my project manager with an example to understand the illustration during WIL.
