Introduction

Work Integrated learning (WIL) an important opportunity for students to be able to find their feet with the information we obtain in the classroom in textbooks and lectures and actually put these teachings into practice in a real-world setting. The purpose of WIL is helps provide students with the reality of the real world with real clients, where the learned academic concepts can be applied, practical skills can be developed and students gain insight into real-world standards and expectations. 

Throughout my WIL placement with U-Turn Homeless Organisation, I was working in a pair with Tshwanelo Ramongalo to help develop NourishNet, a cross platform app that is designed to connect people in need with food donors around the,. I was a part of this project for my contribution to gain an understanding of how the UI can be organised in the best way to guide users through our desired outcomes. I came to understand some parts of the production with him. The value of WIL to me allowe me to tap into managing my communication with a team, decreasing my language barrier when dealing with stakeholder and creating UI structures that were lightweight and user friendly.

Skills Learnt 

Throughout this journey, I created some parts of the user interface like the menu items, wireframes and screens to show you my practical skills of my code with my project manager with an example to understand the illustration during WIL.

Technical Skills and Industry Practices 

Agile Development and SDLC: I learned how to create a login and logout in another semester to show my contribution in the project we created together.Of course the PM gave me some advice to develop every part of the app like homepage, loginpage, patterns, style.css and menu. We created these together and doing this showed me that I have to learn more in design application for the future perspective and to have ability to improve in my coding. The PM taught me how to structure sprint reviews with retrospectives well to help him, which in turn helped me be better at my ability when it comes to managing scope and timelines.

Full-Stack Mobile Development:
Developing the core features in the app with him I gained some more experience in React Native when developing login, post, basic information of the categories, description, verification QR code and views of the presentation of the donations we create together. When developing the donation, posting, claim management screens alongside with Tshwanelo, the process gave me the time to handle cross-platform complexities like IOS, Android and Web together.

Cloud Backend Integration:
Using GitHub actions, we established a CI/CD pipeline to automate the quality checks for code and ran some unit tests (Jest). His responsibility was to test the coverage for all the business logic and prevent regression and mine was to manage the success of it.

UI Quality Assurance:
I was also tasked with making sure that the UI is responsive across devices as we were targeting a wide userbase with all kinds of different devices.


Interpersonal & Management Skills

Client Communication: 
I was tasked to communicate my ideas for the User Interface and how the businesses ideas could be translated through a user friendly UI/

Conflict Resolution: sometimes we had disagreements in terms of the prioritization of some UI elements which we resolved by coming back to what the requirements are and generated a priority list with the most efficient solutions for each outcome. This helped me adopt a model for future versions

Time Management & Prioritization: I had a lot of school projects to deal with while we were meeting with clients and meeting with the group and this taught me how to be strict with my time to ensure all priorities are attended to

Role in the team:

Team Dynamic and Reporting
Our team consisted of myself as the Mobile/UI and Tshwanelo Ramongalo as the PM/full-stack developer. Together we ensured to maintain a codebase and experience that is dynamic, complementary and collaborative. I did  a really good job when it came to visual design which gave me the freedom to filter user actions through strategically placed buttons etc. My role and my contribution was assigned to be The Mobile and UI. The responsibility of my role is allowing me to express myself visually in the development in the app.

Leardership Contribution:
I led the entire UI and mobile department which gave me a sense of ownership and responsibility fell on me for specific issues. This helped isolate issues when they came up without much debate.

Team Success
For the success of the team and to have a successful project, my focus was more on the UI/UX development. Through my work we ensured an application where every user would never feel stuck and that every element and button fell on the right place without causing too much confusion


Technology Used: I used figma to come up with some wireframes and setup a base for our platform, I then created the initial screens based on that which prepared the PM for the backend functionality


Personal Strengths and Weaknesses Personal Strengths:
The part of this WIL I understand that I need to improve my management plan with him because he shows me plan to work on the mobile app after that I work on well in this part of course I did not yet understand the firebase like he did so i performed badly with the coding at first. Some times I make mistake in the code when it is not working and we improvised together. Perfecting this skill allowed us as a team to really take charge of challenges like the buttons not triggering desired actions in the backend.

Security and Quality: I had to make sure that only authenticated users could access certain parts of the app/screens. This was to work with the firebase backend to identify who is allowed and who is not allowed.

Client Communication: he effectively managed client expectations, translating technical project status and risks into clear, non-technical language during check-ins and being a part of those meeting allowed me insight into the real world.

The expectations of the client were managed very efficiently with the technical project risks and status being translated into concise, clear and non-technical language throughout our checkins.

Self-Directed Learning: We quickly mastered React Native and the required Firebase services without much training, allowing me to contribute significantly from Sprint 1.

he was able to rapidly master the React Native library with the help of my team without much guidance as figuring things out along the way and discovering what makes them break is the flow state where I learnt the most about the library and its capabilities cross-platform.

Documentation: We documented all project documentation alongside each other where I was involved with coming up with any diagrams where they needed to be in the POE report and presentation. Using automation tools to improve the efficiency of this process helped me gain a lot of experience for the future, specifically the technical manual and user manual with POE documentation to bring the project together. 

Personal Weaknesses (Areas for Improvement)

UI/UX Design and Visual Polish: I’m the best when it comes to aesthetics and having a good eye for design was a trait. The user flow aspects like styling responsively and the consistency of the design was where I could have improved to help Tshwanelo with the expertise of the UI/UX.

Improvement: Dedicate time to improving modern UI/UX principles and their integrations in design systems to bridge this knowledge gap. Sometimes I took on different tasks independently that were already taken care of which killed development time. 


For my delegation in the part of the team I try my best with some basics I learn from the past few years with a lot of people who explain to me what to do with code I do not understand without seeing what the code means to me before being properly explained as to what to do.

For my improvement I have to get more experience for what to do with my knowledge from coding or design even learning how to get a map in the first coding without giving up when it fails

Stakeholder Relationship

Relationship with Stephen Underwood (Client Supervisor)

The client supervisor was understanding with our approach and for my wireframe ideas before meeting, I sent him some screenshots to get approval before the meeting to reduce time wasted at meetings and allowed me to make more progress more quickly.

I want to learn more for improving the UI to more modern standards like my leader did when he gave me some solutions and tips and I contribute well the development for the menu and map placement part. For another part where i was not involved and never did for the moment is the firebase because I want to practice the way he did it (Firebase, 2025).

Relationship with WIL Coordinator
the coordinator gave use clear instructions on the deliverables we needed to submit and was always available to the criteria of the rubric as this seemed very complicated at the start, their participation really helped.

The coordinator helped me in explaining the complex assessment structure and how best to go about it to ensure he do well and clarified many parts of the rubric criteria including deliverables and how they integrate into the assessment which helped toward the final submission.
The most part I contribute is the presentation of the application we did together but I have to be better for my future project.

For our impact with my project manager (Tshwanelo Ramongalo) he complemented me by offering a firm technical foundation and acted like my mentor in terms of the backend logic and best practices for testing via code reviews and made sure that we shared a collaborative experience together.

Conclusion
For my WIL experience with U-Turn through The NourishNet app was the most part we create combine with our exchange ideas together to improve the project very successful of course with his guidances I could not be here without him. I have more to learn from him like get a strategic project like him one day.
